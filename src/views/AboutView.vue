      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi! I am a junior at Brigham Young University studying
        applied mathematics with an emphasis in machine learning and deep
        learning. I am taking web design this semester just for fun!</p>

      <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I know this says "Talia Bird Photography" but I did not
        take any of these photos. I love photography and art and so
        for my project decided to combine a bunch of photos from
        throughout history. I used images that I felt reflected
        events, people, and places that have shaped my life and
        the lives of many, many others. My reviews are not reviews of my
        work (since this isn't even my work to begin with) but rather
        reviews of scholarly work I found interesting. I hope you enjoy!</p>
